        <h2>Users and Roles</h2>
        A user account is <b>not</b> required to use AntNupTracker. However, to report ant nuptial flights and leave comments on flight records, a user account is needed.
        <br>
        There are two types of AntNupTracker users:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Citizen Scientist</b>: This option is for users who are ant enthusiasts, but do not have formal training in the study of ants and do not work in a field directly related to ants.</li>
            <li><b>Professional Myrmecologist</b>: This option is for users who have a degree related to myrmecology, the study of ants, or who work in a field directly related to ants. 
                These users are identified in AntNupTracker by the ant icon. In addition to the features that Citizen Scientists can perform, 
                Professional Myrmecologists can mark flight records as "Validated" by pressing on the ant icon in the top bar of the flight detail screen. 
                Validated flights and flights that have been recorded by Professional Myrmecologists have a green ant icon beside them in the flight list.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="helpImagesContainer">
            <div class="helpImageContainer"><img class="helpContainedImage" src="{% static 'nuptiallog/images/antBlue.svg' %}"><br>This icon is used to denote <b>Professional Myrmecologists</b>. A green version also appears beside flights that have been validated or that were uploaded by a Professional Myrmecologist.</div>
            <div class="helpImageContainer"><img class="helpContainedImage" src="{% static 'nuptiallog/images/professionalCell.png' %}"><br>This row contains a flight record reported by a <b>Professional Myrmecologist</b>. Note the two ant icons: the blue one beside the username indicates that the user who reported the flight is a <b>Professional Myrmecologist</b> while the green one indicates that the flight is validated.</div>
            <div class="helpImageContainer"><img class="helpContainedImage" src="{% static 'nuptiallog/images/detailHeader.png' %}">
                <br>
                This is the header displayed on the flight detail screen.
                <ul style="text-align: left;">
                    <li>Whenever a user is logged in, the <i>Comment</i> <img src="{% static 'nuptiallog/images/commentIcon.svg' %}"> button is active, as any user can write comments on any flight.</li>
                    <li>If the user is logged in as a <b>Professional Myrmecologist</b>, the <i>Validate</i> <img src="{% static 'nuptiallog/images/validateIcon.svg' %}"> button is active if the flight is not already validated.</li>
                    <li>If the user is the one who reported the flight record, the <i>Edit</i> button is active.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <b>Note: All flights uploaded by Professional Myrmecologists are implicitly considered validated.</b>

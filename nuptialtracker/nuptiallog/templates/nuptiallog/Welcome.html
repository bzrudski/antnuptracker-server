            <b>Our project has two goals. First, we want to enable scientists to use the timing of <a href="{% url 'about' %}">ant nuptial flights</a> to monitor environmental changes on a global scale. 
                Second, we want to help people collect ants in a less destructive and disruptive manner. </b>
            <br><br>
            To achieve these goals, we have developed <i>AntNupTracker</i>, a mobile app that allows reporting of ant nuptial flights from the field in order to build an <b>open and publicly-accessible</b> database of ant nuptial flight records.
            This database can either be browsed in the app, <a href="{% url 'browse' %}">online</a> or <a href="{% url 'download' %}">downloaded</a> in the format of your choice. 
            Whether you are a beginner or a professional myrmecologist, we invite you to share in our passion for ants and contribute to this citizen science project! 
            <a href="{% url 'create-account' %}">Sign up</a> and download the app to begin!
            <br><br>
            Enjoy tracking those ants!
